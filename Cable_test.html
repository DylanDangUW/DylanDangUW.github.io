                    I'm in my first year at UWB, but I'm already applying to the IMD major. I'm excited to learn more about designing media, like websites and games.
                    I enjoy photography, gaming, hanging out with friends, eating, and playing music. My hope for this class is to better understand how websites are designed
                    and develop my ability to format a visually pleasing one.
