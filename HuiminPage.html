        <h2>About myself</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone, I'm Huimin and I'm excited to attend this class and learn about web technologies</p>
        <p>I don't have a lot to talk about myself, so I can share about some information about my dog <strong>Luna</strong>:)</p>
        <p>She is a <em>Shipoo dog</em>, 4 months old, here is what I like about her: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>She is very cute puppy, only 6 pounds right now</li>
            <li>She likes people, especially new people, and she doesn't bark much</li>
            <li>She follows me around all day and we play a lot in backyard</li>
          </ul>
